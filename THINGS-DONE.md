# QuickGigs — Things We've Done (Beta)

Last updated: July 2026  
Platform: [quickgigs.ca](https://quickgigs.ca)  
Stack: Firebase Auth + Supabase + static HTML/JS frontend

---

## One-liner summary

**QuickGigs beta:** Full task marketplace — post, browse, apply, accept, chat, complete, and review. Public profiles with photos, bio, skills, and reviews. Supabase backend, Firebase auth, mobile-friendly UI, fraud protection in chat, and beta database setup. Payments, email alerts, in-app notifications, and production security (RLS) planned for launch.

---

## Core marketplace

- **Post tasks** — categories, budget, location, animated schedule/date picker, optional task photos
- **Browse & apply** — task cards, Quick/Standard mode filters, category pills, apply modal with fraud checks
- **My Tasks** — Posted / Applied / In progress / Completed tabs
- **Applicant flow** — accept, decline, withdraw applications
- **In progress** — message tasker/poster, mark complete, change tasker, cancel task
- **Real posted times** — replaced generic “Recently” with actual relative times on browse and My Tasks
- **Task caching** — offline/stale fallback when Supabase is slow

---

## Profiles

- **Modern profile page** — animated avatar ring, stats, bio, skills, reviews
- **Profile Studio** — redesigned edit flow (not task-form style), progress ring, animated skill chips, live bio counter
- **View anyone’s profile** — `profile.html?user=FIREBASE_UID`
- **Profile links** — from browse (poster name), My Tasks (applicants/posters/taskers), messages, chat header, review names
- **Photo rules** — taskers must have a photo to apply; posters optional
- **Bio & skills in Supabase** — sync across devices (not only browser localStorage)
- **Reviews on profiles** — persist with DB + local cache fallback
- **Auto-migrate** — existing bio/skills in localStorage upload to Supabase on next visit

---

## Messaging & chat

- **Chat unlocks on accept** — beta config (`chatUnlockAfter: 'accept'`)
- **Chat fixes** — poster ↔ tasker messaging after accept, conversation lookup, unlock on open
- **Fraud blocking** — phone numbers, emails, and social handles blocked in chat
- **Poster-only image attach** — reference photos in chat (no IDs/personal documents)
- **Messages list** — active/completed sections, unread indicators, profile links on avatar/name

---

## Photos & storage

- **Profile photo uploads** — `profile-photos` bucket + RLS
- **Task photo uploads** — `task-photos` bucket + RLS
- **Chat photo uploads** — `chat-photos` bucket + RLS
- **Human-readable upload errors** — `formatUploadError()` for 403 and other failures
- **Post without photos fallback** — task can still post if photo upload fails

---

## Auth & signup

- **Firebase auth** — login, signup, password reset
- **Role-based signup** — poster vs tasker
- **Mode selector** — poster/tasker session modes
- **Auto-capitalize names** on signup
- **Tasker photo setup** — redirect to profile after worker signup; posters go to dashboard

---

## Database (Supabase)

Run in **Supabase → SQL Editor** (safe to re-run where noted):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `supabase/beta-setup-all.sql` | **Main beta setup** — tasks, applications, users, chat, reviews RLS, storage |
| `supabase/profile-bio-skills.sql` | Bio + skills columns on users |
| `supabase/messaging.sql` | Creates `conversations` + `messages` tables (if missing) |
| `supabase/storage-beta-fix.sql` | Photo upload 403 fix alone |
| `supabase/rls-secure.sql` | **Launch only** — do NOT run until Firebase is enabled in Supabase |

### Tables covered in beta

- `tasks` — poster name, status, schedule, photo URLs
- `applications` — worker name, status (pending/accepted/declined)
- `users` — firebase_uid, avatar_url, bio, skills, name, role
- `conversations` + `messages` — chat
- `reviews` — ratings and comments on profiles
- Storage buckets — profile-photos, task-photos, chat-photos

---

## Mobile & UX

- **Mobile bottom nav** on main app pages
- **Keyboard dismiss** and responsive chat layout
- **Light/dark mode** on main app pages (some light-mode issues still flagged by tester)
- **Post task contrast** and validation fixes
- **Completed tab fix** — stays on Completed after mark complete; URL `?tab=completed`

---

## Legal & landing (partial)

- **`terms.html`** and **`privacy.html`** — full legal pages
- **Footer links** on: index, login, dashboard, feedback
- **`index.html`** — beta live landing with poster/tasker CTAs (not pure “coming soon”)

---

## Admin

- **`admin.html`** — dashboard UI shell (users, tasks, disputes, analytics)
- **Demo data** — disputes, revenue, some stats are placeholders
- **Manual warn/ban** in UI — not automated, not fully wired to live DB

---

## Partially done

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Search tasks by keyword | On Browse only (title, category, description) — no global search |
| Task categories | Filter pills on browse — no dedicated categories page |
| Terms/privacy footer | On landing, login, dashboard, feedback — missing on browse, post task, My Tasks, chat, messages, profile |
| Light mode | Theme exists; tester-reported issues not fully fixed |
